Display your Last.fm listening activity on your WordPress site with native Gutenberg blocks.

== Description ==

Scrobbled Blocks brings your Last.fm listening history to your WordPress site using native Gutenberg blocks. Whether you're a music blogger, podcaster, DJ, or just want to share your musical tastes with your audience, this plugin makes it simple.

= Two Powerful Blocks =

**Now Playing Block**
Display the track you're currently listening to, or the most recent track you've played. Perfect for sidebars, footers, or anywhere you want to show off your current musical mood.

**Recently Played Block**
Show a list or grid of your recent scrobbles. Configurable from 1-20 tracks, with flexible layout options to match your site's design.

= Key Features =

* **Live Editor Preview** - See your actual Last.fm data while editing in Gutenberg
* **Flexible Layouts** - Choose between list and grid views for the Recently Played block
* **Customisable Display** - Toggle artwork, timestamps, and Last.fm links on or off
* **Smart Caching** - Minimises API calls while keeping data fresh (1 min for Now Playing, 5 min for Recently Played)
* **Graceful Degradation** - If the API is unavailable, cached data is served; if no cache exists, blocks simply don't render
* **Theme-Friendly Styling** - Uses CSS custom properties so you can easily match your theme
* **Responsive Design** - Looks great on all screen sizes
* **Custom Placeholder** - Upload your own placeholder image for tracks without artwork


= External Services =

This plugin connects to the Last.fm API to retrieve your public listening history and display it on your WordPress site.

**What data is sent:**

* Your Last.fm username
* Your Last.fm API key
* The number of tracks to retrieve

**When data is sent:**

* When the Now Playing or Recently Played blocks are displayed on a page
* Data is cached locally to minimise API requests (1 minute for Now Playing, 5 minutes for Recently Played)

**Service provider:**

This service is provided by Last.fm Ltd.

* [Last.fm Terms of Service](https://www.last.fm/legal/terms)
* [Last.fm Privacy Policy](https://www.last.fm/legal/privacy)

No personal data from your site visitors is collected or sent to Last.fm. Only your configured Last.fm username and API key are transmitted to retrieve your public listening data.

**Optional: cover art lookup**

Last.fm serves its own grey star image for releases it has no cover for. If "Missing Cover Lookup" is enabled in the plugin settings, those albums are looked up on one additional service of your choosing. This is off by default.

* iTunes (default) -- the artist and album name are sent to https://itunes.apple.com/search. [Apple Media Services Terms](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/) | [Apple Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/)
* Deezer -- the artist and album name are sent to https://api.deezer.com/search/album. [Deezer Terms of Use](https://www.deezer.com/legal/cgu) | [Deezer Privacy Policy](https://www.deezer.com/legal/personal-datas)

Only the artist and album name are sent, and only for albums where Last.fm supplied no cover. No API key or account is required for either service, nothing about your site visitors is transmitted, and results are cached locally for 30 days.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get a Last.fm API key? =

Visit [https://www.last.fm/api/account/create](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create) and create an API application. You'll receive an API key immediately. The Shared Secret is not needed for this plugin.

= Why isn't my currently playing track showing as "now playing"? =

Last.fm only reports "now playing" status while the track is actively being scrobbled by your music player. If you pause or stop playback, Last.fm no longer reports it as currently playing, so the plugin shows it as your most recently played track instead.

= How often does the data refresh? =

* **Now Playing block:** Caches for 1 minute
* **Recently Played block:** Caches for 5 minutes

This balances freshness with responsible API usage. If the API is temporarily unavailable, the plugin will serve stale cached data (up to 24 hours old) rather than showing nothing.

= Why isn't album artwork showing for some tracks? =

Not all tracks on Last.fm have associated album artwork. When artwork is unavailable, the plugin displays a placeholder image. You can upload a custom placeholder in Settings > Scrobbled Blocks.

= Can I use this with the Classic Editor? =

Scrobbled Blocks requires the Gutenberg block editor. If you're using the Classic Editor plugin, you won't be able to use these blocks directly. Consider using a page builder that supports Gutenberg blocks, or enabling the block editor for specific post types.


= How do I style the blocks to match my theme? =

The plugin uses CSS custom properties that you can override. See the "CSS Customisation" section below.

= Is this plugin compatible with caching plugins? =

Yes. The plugin uses WordPress transients for its own caching, which works alongside page caching plugins. However, if you use aggressive page caching, the "Now Playing" data may be slightly delayed. Consider excluding pages with the Now Playing block from full-page caching if real-time accuracy is important.

== CSS Customisation ==

The plugin uses CSS custom properties (CSS variables) for easy theming. Add these to your theme's CSS to override the defaults:

`
:root {
    /* Artwork sizes */
    --scrobble-artwork-size: 64px;
    --scrobble-artwork-size-grid: 100%;

    /* Spacing */
    --scrobble-gap: 1rem;

    /* Typography */
    --scrobble-font-size-track: inherit;
    --scrobble-font-size-artist: 0.875em;
    --scrobble-font-size-timestamp: 0.75em;

    /* Colours */
    --scrobble-color-text: inherit;
    --scrobble-color-text-secondary: inherit;
    --scrobble-color-link: inherit;
}
`

= Example: Larger Artwork =

`
:root {
    --scrobble-artwork-size: 100px;
}
`

= Example: Custom Colours =

`
:root {
    --scrobble-color-text: #333;
    --scrobble-color-text-secondary: #666;
    --scrobble-color-link: #1db954;
}
`
